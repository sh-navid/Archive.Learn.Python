# OOP

- Each object has a unique identity.
- Each object can contain several other objects.
- Each object can have a series of attributes.
- Every object has a set of behaviors.

- An object is an instance created from a class. The process of making this sample is called instantiation.

## 4 fundamental concepts of object oriented programming
  - Abstraction
    - When we talk about "animal", we are not referring to a specific animal. This is an abstract concept.
    - Abstraction occurs when a programmer hides irrelevant data about an object or class to reduce complexity.
  - Polymorphism
    - Ability to take different forms.
      - [With inheritance and class method](polymorphism-with-inheritance.py)
      - [With function](polymorphism-with-functions.py)
  - [Inheritance](oop-inheritance.py)
    - Is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties of another class, in the same way that a child inherits certain properties from each of its parents.
  - [Encapsulation](oop-encapsulation.py)
    - Means "putting one or more items in a physical or logical package." Encapsulation in object-oriented programming limits access to implementation details.
    - Is implemented by access specifiers. Access level attributes define the scope of class members.
      - [Access Modifiers](oop-access-modifiers.py)
        - public
        - protected
        - private
